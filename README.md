# Unity-Space-Game
A 3D version of asteroids minus looping using Unity.
Enemy ships fly around to shoot players down.
A simple title screen and results screen are also implemented.
Up to four players are supported.
Object Pooling is used to spawn asteroids, bullets, and enemy fighters.
Singleton-like objects are also demonstrated.
I won't be uploading the actual project or assets since I do not want to come across any copyright issues.
